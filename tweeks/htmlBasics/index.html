						<h1>Creating your first HTML document</h1>
						<p>
							Describing the importance of opening and closing your tags and what a closing tag looks like. We will start to go over the basic tags that are used in a HTML document and cover how they are used. We will dig into what the heck HTML 5 is and why CSS3 is cool, we wil also cover exactly why you need to cover your website in cascading sheets.

						<h2>Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
						<p>
							Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation semantics (the look and formatting) of a document written in a markup language. Its most common application is to style web pages written in HTML and XHTML, but the language can also be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSs">Wikipedia</a>

						<h2>Javascript</h2>
						<p>
							Javascript is a really amaizing lauguange that many of you have probably heard a lot about and I will cover it just breifly.  This lauguage is so powerful and complex that to do it any real justice full classes would have to be created to cover it and it would take hours to develop.  I encourge any one who is interested in learning more about the topic to search online as there are vast quanities of knowlege on the subject.

					<h3>Templates</h3>
					<p>
						This page is a template. I downloaded it from the <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">html5 boilerplate</a> website.  Templates and boiler plates are wonderful as they help you quickly get started working on the code and designs of your site with out worring about remembing what you need to include in your page. I did tweak it, and add the LPCPL feel.
