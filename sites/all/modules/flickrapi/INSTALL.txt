INSTALLATION:

1) Place this module directory in your modules folder (this will usually be
   "sites/all/modules/").

2) Enable the module.

3) Go to admin/config/media/flickrapi

4) Enter your API Key and optionally your API Shared Secret. See
   http://www.flickr.com/services/api to register for a key.

5) After saving, the form will send you to Flickr.com to authenticate
   your website using OAuth. You will have 'read' permissions by default.

6) More permissions (write/delete) or disabling caching can be set using the
   the Advanced Settings. Changing permissions afterwards forces you to re-authenticate.
